    <em>Millet Drink</em>
    <p>
        Millet is a group of gluten-free ancient grains that offer several health benefits. It's widely consumed in developing countries throughout Africa and Asia. Millets are a group of cereal grains that belong to the Poaceae family, commonly known as the grass family.<br> 
        There are several types of millets such as barnyard millet, foxtail millet, finger millet, pearl millet, proso millet, sorghum and little millet <br>
        I found a recipe for a millet drink called Millet Original Drink which is a healthy and gluten-free choice
